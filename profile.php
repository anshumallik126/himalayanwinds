                    <p class="mb-4">I discovered the sound of bansuri when I was in my 20s. In Nepal, I studied bansuri
                        for about four years at a music university called Kalani Dei, and since 2003 I have been
                        studying with Mr. Carlos Guerra in Japan, and since then I have been studying with Mr. Hiroshi
                        Nakagawa, a well-known bansuri player in Japan. In 2010 and 2012, I went to India to work with
                        Mr. Hariprasad Chautisya, a world-renowned Bansuri player who is said to be the God of Bansuri,
                        and was also taught by Himanchu Nanda. .
